Updates

we are going to have it so a bronze nugget can be found in 
dungons and you combine that with 2 black dye and a cyan dye 
to make a fether of magic then that with gold around it like 
a clock makes a magic compass that leads you to the dungon that 
gen once per world and in the dungon there is a block and if you 
right click it it spawns magic stuff around the world and gives 
magics abilitles like the mobs and more dungons So like super fancy 
ass thaumcraft/ars magica effects and we will add fancy ass bronze 
armor and markets gen and 'nome' bases for each biome gens rare but 
a type for each biome after the block was activated and also underground 
towns(only in desert) like only thing that is from the mod with out the 
block active is the fether the bronze and the magic compass invs to the mortal eye
